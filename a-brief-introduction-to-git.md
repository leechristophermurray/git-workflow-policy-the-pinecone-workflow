# A Breif Instroduction to Git

## What is Version Control?

Any system that keeps, historical snapshots of modifications to one or more files throughout time, where these historical snapshots can be referred to and revisited later, is considered one which manages and therefore controls versions. These are version control systems \(VCS\) and therefore version control enables us to keep snapshots so that we can revert to previous states\(Chacon, S. & Straub, B. 2014\). As the use of version control systems became popular different systems emerged and different methods to manage versions also emerged.

## What is Git?

Whereas other VCS’s store versions as a file changes, git was developed to store an entire project- directories and files -as snapshots and linking unchanged files to the last change occurrence of its change rather than saving the file’s snapshot again. This allows git the advantage of keeping its versioning footprint small, much smaller than competing VCS’s. Git was developed to be distributed and also comes with the advantage of being free an open source. This allows parallel/non-linear development on projects and improves its accessibility. Furthermore, the core of git itself is small enough that minimal hardware can run it. Git introduces even more simplicity in creating versions of projects \(branches\) in a way that is far simpler and less time consuming than centralized version control systems \(CVCS\) arecapableof \(tutorialspoint.com.

## Setup

Git may be downloaded and installed by following the instructions found on this page: [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). For windows, there is an installer provided, and for \*nix systems there are command line instructions for the specific OS you may be using. Also, for \*nix systems, should there be a software repository or store, it is likely you will find git there.
